# Classification
Cardiovascular Risk Prediction

Objective
To build a classification model that predicts the risk of cardiovascular disease based on patient data such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking habits, and physical activity. The aim was to assist in early risk identification using data-driven methods to potentially support preventive healthcare measures.


✅ What I Learned
Gained a solid understanding of the end-to-end machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, and evaluation.

Applied classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Learned how to handle imbalanced data using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.

Practiced data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers, standardizing formats) on medical datasets.

Learned to interpret confusion matrices, ROC curves, precision-recall tradeoffs, and AUC scores.

Developed skills in comparing model performance and tuning hyperparameters for optimal results.


✅ What I Achieved
Successfully built a classification model with an accuracy of X% and AUC score of Y% (add actual values if available).

Identified key risk indicators such as age, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol level, and BMI as most predictive of cardiovascular risk.

Visualized the distribution of cardiovascular risk across different demographics using Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.

Documented all stages in a well-structured Jupyter Notebook with explanations for reproducibility.

Created a baseline for potential deployment in a clinical decision support system or wellness platform.
